pip uninstall tensorflow python-doctr
```*(You can run this command multiple times if it says the package is not found, just to be sure).*

#### Step 2: Install Compatible Versions

Now, install a version of TensorFlow that is less than 2.16. Then, reinstall `python-doctr` which will use the version of TensorFlow you just installed.

```bash
# Install a specific, compatible version of TensorFlow
pip install "tensorflow<2.16"

# Now, install doctr with the TensorFlow backend dependencies
pip install "python-doctr[tf]"
